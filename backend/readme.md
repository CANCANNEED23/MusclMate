# How To Run The Backend
- if there's no directory (folder) called `node_modules`
    - make sure your terminal is currently in the `backend` directory
        - if you can't tell, run `ls` in the terminal and see if it lists the 
        contents of the `backend` directory
    - run `npm install` in the terminal
    - this will install all necessary libaries into this folder

- then, once all libraries are installed - run `npm start`
    - this will run the server on your local network 
- `index.ts` is the app that will be run (using `nodemon`)
    - if you're ever confused about the required inputs and ouputs from an api, you can check there
